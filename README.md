TensorFlow implementation of **Non-Parametric Transformation Networks (NPTNs)**,
as described in ["Non-Parametric Transformation Networks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04520.pdf) (2018) by Dipan K. Pal and Marios Savvides.

See `train_cifar10.py` for example code.

There is also a Keras implementation of the baseline CNN described in the paper. See `train_baseline.py`.
